TO DO:

- delete compound = delete calibration model entry, too.
- check ADD targets / compounds, too.
- replicates - for profiling!
- no row numbers in files & compound tables to avoid confusion with ID
- empty space (issue when copypaste?) at end of values in plotting for search window cause non-evaluation; and only evaluate when it is selected!
- check into which environment read.csv reads, use input$file_overview_brush as example ("measurements" are not locally available? e.g. problesm if you make rm(these))


- dont_scripts must not contain parameters (- undo nodes will remain unaffected by parameter changes)
- dont_scripts must not modify node marks in the measurements table; the latter are instead modified via function workflow_set
